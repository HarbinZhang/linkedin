Traditionally an RF source is used to excite the exotic gasses used in a semiconductor process chamber that are then ignited to create a plasma.  Essentially the RF source is a switched-mode power supply (i.e. class E amplifier) ranging from two to ten kilowatt of output power  coupled into a near-zero impedance load through a large, cumbersome, slow-to-adjust, network of stepper-motor driven mechanically tunable capacitors called, among other things, the match works.  OnChamber RF used a solid-state approach to the matching network and integrated it into the RF source resulting in a product that could tune from one end of its impedance matching range to the other in microseconds as opposed to seconds.  The result was an RF source that achieved something that was previously unheard of - The ability to maintain plasma through rapidly changing gases which cause very sever impedance transitions.\n\nWe developed the value proposition and created a business plan that conservatively showed an ROI under three years with a NPV in excess of $25M. I focused the engineering team and developed marketing collateral to generate customer interest.  We worked closely with a customer that was cautiously delighted with the capability.  That's about when the world started to crumbled in 2008.  As funding was reigned in, we put RF OnChamber to sleep, and I took over the ASTRON business unit, a remote plasma source used to create atomic fluorine for cleaning process chambers.  Focusing on solar and flat-panel markets, the BU achieved 5% annual growth during the first years of the downturn."],["VP Engineering | Product Development | R\u0026D","Microwave Radio Communications","Stephen M. Pereira","View","MRC's Engineering department was comprised of 18 engineers when I assumed leadership as VP Engineering. At the time they were trapped in a development cycle that was more than a year behind schedule with ill-defined requirements for a new product platform, Strata. I spent my first six months refining requirements, negotiating with internal stakeholders, and basic blocking-and-tackling style project management to get the first version of the new platform into manufacturing. Over the years Strata and its derivatives generated $30M to $50M annually.\n\nMRC's main market segment, Electronic News Gathering (ENG), was undergoing significant changes due to the FCC's spectrum reallocation plans as well as the shift to high-definition video. As a result of this mandated re-tooling, MRC's revenue tripled from 2003 through 2007. To meet the demands of this expansive growth, I double the size of Engineering during that period significantly enhancing design strengths in video compression, RF, DSP, embedded systems, packaging, and thermal management. The strength of that team was evident in the various TV Technology awards for products such as Strata, QuikVue, and the MXT series.\n\nOne of my major concerns during that time was eliminating choke-points in the business processes that would impede growth. I led and facilitated a team that redefined the company's product realization process. We used a nodal analysis and flow diagram methodology that stretched across three whiteboards to analyze and refine the processes. This effort resulted in a streamlined purpose-built end-to-end product realization process that reduced order processing time by more than12%, reduced scrap, and minimized excess inventory."],["VP Engineering | Product Development","Thales Broadcast and Multimedia","I went to Thales B\u0026M to manage the digital design function at the Broadcast division in what was previously the Comark facility south of Springfield, MA during the early days of the HDTV transition, and was immediately promoted to Director of Engineering.  \n\nAt the time, the Wireless division of B\u0026M, located in the Wilkes Barre - Scranton area, was struggling to re-tool their wireless cable product for the new last-mile Fixed Wireless Broadband market.  I established processes that split the product development workload between the engineering organizations of the Broadcast and Wireless divisions to leveraged the core competencies of each as I moved into the VP Engineering role.  This streamlined the release process, minimized design errors, and enabled the Wireless division to win over $24M worth of business from WorldCom, Sprint, and Nortel. \n\nThe collapse of telecom in 2001, which coincided with the dot-com collapse, brought this profitable venture to a pre-mature demise."],["Manager | Digital Design | Products","Glenayre","I went to Glenayre during the peak years of the Paging industry as a design engineer and ended up managing the digital design and software functions.

The challenge was to present this new, unfamiliar technique as a powerful way to investigate their samples and produce groundbreaking results.\n\nOver the first two years, I had developed sales materials and product presentations to educate our potential customers about this new technique.  Now, because the customer base was skeptical of unfamiliar technology, they weren't immediately receptive to these marketing materials.  For this reason, I played the role of an educator rather than marketing manager.  By delivering product introductions at prestigious laboratories, universities, and national symposia, I was able to communicate the advantages of the technology and establish myself as a valuable contributor and asset to their research program.  Throughout this process, I developed excellent rapport and credibility with this customer base which, in large part, fueled company growth and positioned us as market leader.  My sales materials shaped the way microscopists think about multiphoton microscopy and, to this day, the marketing collateral is still extremely relevant.  \n\nInternally, I was responsible for communicating external customer requests to product development.  Based on this information, 5 new products were developed to address the increasingly demanding customer requirements.
